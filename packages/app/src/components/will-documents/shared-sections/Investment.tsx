          It is my wish but I do not direct that in making substantial
          investments my executor and Trustees obtain and consider the advice of
          someone who is experienced and knowledgeable in financial and
          investment planning and where appropriate is also a member of the
          Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Australian Society of
          Certified Practising Accountants, the Australian Stock Exchange or the
          Financial Planning Association of Australia Limited. It is my wish,
          but I do not require, that in considering and making investments and
          managing my estate my executors obtain and consider the advice of an
          appropriately qualified person in good standing who is experienced and
          knowledgeable in financial and investment planning.
