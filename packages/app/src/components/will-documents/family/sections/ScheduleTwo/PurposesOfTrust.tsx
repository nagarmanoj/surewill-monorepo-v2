          The primary purposes for which my trustees hold the fund on trust are
          directly or indirectly to provide for or promote the maintenance,
          education (including travel to broaden the mind), advancement or
          benefit of a beneficiary or beneficiaries; and to give to my trustees
          the widest possible discretion in using their powers in carrying out
          those purposes. The purposes of the trust as stated in this clause are
          to be read in their general meaning, and in no way limit the
          discretion of my trustees to decide from time to time whether or not
          to provide a benefit or benefits to any beneficiary: I emphasise that
          there is no obligation on my trustees ever to provide a benefit of any
          kind, to or for any beneficiary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where the primary beneficiary is under the preservation age, I express
          the wish (without limiting the discretion of my trustees) that my
          trustees preserve the capital of the fund and as far as seems to them
          reasonable limit its application to the primary beneficiaryâ€™s medical
          and dental treatment, education (including vocational training),
          reasonable maintenance and welfare.
